Feature Requests:

 * jpease:
    1. Display minutes remaining in SLA
    2. Display assignee
 * j4:
    1. Color scale
 * cv:
    1. Another view:
        Sort tickets by time remaining, draw all on one circle, stacking. Details on
        hover, link on click. Maybe round to 10s increments or so, maybe also
        disambiguate close tix somehow, e.g. callout or split the radius.
    2. Show just my tickets
 * me:
    1. Update on a configurable frequency
    2. Force-refresh button
    3. Graph entry animations
    4. Graph code refactor / cleanup
    5. Add multiple dash views, switchable via topbar selector
    6. Ticket length view (by back/forth iterations, and by time open)
 * caprice:
    1. Colorblind friendly
        note from Jimmy -- hatching works well here, instead of a color.
        d3 can handle this using an SVG pattern tag
 * jwhite:
    1. Tooltip w/ assignee name
